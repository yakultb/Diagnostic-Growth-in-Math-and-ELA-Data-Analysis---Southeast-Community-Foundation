# Diagnostic-Growth-in-Math-and-ELA-Data-Analysis---Southeast-Community-Foundation

The Southeast Community Foundation (SCF), in partnership with Woodcraft Rangers, launched the 2022 Summer Tutoring Pilot to provide free, high-dosage tutoring for 52 students in Huntington Park and South Gate. Over a five-week period, the program was designed to bridge educational gaps and offer meaningful learning opportunities to local youth during the summer break. Tutoring sessions were held at Salt Lake Park and Madison Elementary School, creating nurturing and accessible environments where students could engage with educators in supportive, collaborative settings.

Our team contributed by conducting a data analysis of the program outcomes, leveraging Power BI to examine student participation, academic progress, and engagement trends. Through data visualization and reporting, we provided insights into the effectiveness of the tutoring model, highlighting areas of strength and identifying opportunities for improvement. This analysis was used to assess not only academic outcomes but also the broader impact of community engagement and accessibility.

The project underscored the importance of data-informed decision-making in education. By combining SCFâ€™s community-driven approach with our analytical findings, the pilot demonstrated how targeted tutoring, supported by data insights, can drive measurable improvements in student learning while fostering a sense of community. The results of this work contributed to a stronger understanding of how local initiatives can scale to address systemic educational inequities and serve as models for future programming.
